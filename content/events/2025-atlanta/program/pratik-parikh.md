I will talk about what is an Internal Development Platform (IDP) and how it
serves as a powerful too for Developers and DevOps teams. I will highlight what
are the benefits of having an IDP and share some concrete implementation ideas
about implementing one in your organization. Additionally, I will provide a
detailed case study of how I built at IDP on Kubernetes and discuss the
challenges encountered during the process and some valuable lessons learnt.
